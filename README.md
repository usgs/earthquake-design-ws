## Using the Generated Project

## Getting Started

Before developing locally, you will need to execute the following steps to
setup your local environment:

1. Run `npm install` to install application development dependencies

   - The application will prompt you for configuration information,
     and create a file named `src/conf/config.json` in the project.

     > The application expects that the configured postgres database already
     > exists. If you set "database name" to anything other than "postgres"
     > you will need to manually create the database after installing the
     > postgres instance

1. Setup a postgis enabled Postgres database
   - Use the [mdillon/postgis](https://hub.docker.com/r/mdillon/postgis/)
     image to install a docker container running Postgres:
     ```
     docker run
       --name postgres-postgis \
       -p {DB_PORT}:5432 \
       -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD={DB_PASSWORD} \
       -d mdillon/postgis
     ```
1. Run data loading process for component data end points:
   - `node src/lib/db/load_data.js`
1. Run `npm run dev` from the install directory

## Docker

### Building an image

- From root of project, run:
  ```
  docker build -t usgs/earthquake-design-ws:latest .
  ```

### Running a container

When initially creating a container from the base image, you must provide
several configuration parameters based on your working environment.

- Required configuration

  - `MOUNT_PATH`: The base URL path on which to listen for requests. This can
    be any path, or an empty path to listen on slash "/".
  - `PORT`: The port number on which to listen for connections. This can be
    any available port on the host system.

- Start the container using the image tag.

  > In the command below, replace values in brackets `{VALUE}` with the
  > corresponding configuration value determined above.

  ```
  docker run -d
    --name earthquake-design-ws \
    -p {PORT}:8000 \
    -e MOUNT_PATH={MOUNT_PATH} \
    -e LEGACY_URL={LEGACY_URL} \
    usgs/earthquake-design-ws:latest
  ```

  > Alternatively you may use `docker-compose` to start the container. Prior to
  > starting the container you should update the relevant configuration
  > information in the docker-compose.yml file and then run the command:

  ```
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- Connect to the running container in browser.

  > In the URL below, replace values in brackets `{VALUE}` with the
  > corresponding configuration value determined above.

  ```
  http://localhost:{PORT}{MOUNT_PATH}
  ```

- Stopping and starting the container. Once you have successfully created
  and configured a container from a base image (above), you can subsequently
  start and stop the container with the following commands.

  ```
  docker stop earthquake-design-ws
  docker start earthquake-design-ws
  docker restart earthquake-design-ws
  ```

  If you created the container using the `docker-compose` method, you can
  start and stop the container with the following commands instead:

  ```
  docker-compose stop
  docker-compose start
  docker-compose restart
  ```
